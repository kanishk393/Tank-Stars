# Tank Stars Clone (libGDX)

This repository contains the implementation of a clone for the famous game "Tank Stars" using the libGDX framework. This project was developed as part of the Advanced Programming course at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi, under the guidance of Dr. Koteswar Rao.

## Description

This project aimed to create a clone of the popular game "Tank Stars" using the libGDX framework. The libGDX framework is a cross-platform development framework that allows for creating fun and interactive applications.

Key features of the Tank Stars clone:

- Gameplay: The game includes the core gameplay mechanics of the original Tank Stars game. Players control tanks and engage in turn-based battles with other players or AI-controlled opponents.

- Tank Customization: Players can customize their tanks by selecting different types of tanks, weapons, and upgrades. This adds a strategic element to the game, as players can choose the best combination of tanks and weapons for different scenarios.

- Physics Simulation: The game incorporates simulation to provide realistic tank movement and projectile physics. Tanks can move across the terrain and fire projectiles that follow actual trajectories, considering factors such as gravity and wind.

- Multiplayer Support: The game supports multiplayer functionality, allowing players to battle with other players over a network connection. This adds an exciting competitive aspect to the gameplay experience.

By developing this Tank Stars clone, I gained practical experience in game development using the libGDX framework. I learned about game physics, user input handling, graphics rendering, and multiplayer networking.

## Usage

To run the Tank Stars clone, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kanishk393/Tank-Stars.git
   ```

2. Set up the libGDX environment on your machine by following the official documentation: [libGDX Setup](https://libgdx.com/dev/setup/)

3. Import the project into your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports libGDX development, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

4. Build and run the project using the libGDX development tools provided by your IDE.

5. Enjoy playing the Tank Stars clone!
